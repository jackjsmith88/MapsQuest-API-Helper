Hi Guys, Just wanted to share with you some software i built.

Its a User-Friendly application that uses The MapQuest API to process batch calls for GeoCoding.

Make sure you head to MapQuest and grab a Free API key. (15,000 requests before you're billed but i wont be responsible for any charges, check carefully before processing in case the plans have changed)

Needs Windows, and an installation of Excel.
